# ðŸ˜Ž VSKit (Visual Studio Code Kit)

**VSKit** is an advanced, intelligent development kit designed for Visual Studio Code. It simplifies the creation of containerized solutions by automating the entire lifecycleâ€” from local development to deployment. With VSKit, you can seamlessly manage your development environment, CI/CD pipelines, and container registry integration.

ðŸŒŒ SkyModules.io VS Kits:

## ðŸ˜Ž Key Features

- **VS Code Dev Containers**: Streamlined setup for development within containers.
- **GitHub Integration**: Full support for GitHub Actions, SSH integration, and secrets management.


## Quick Start Guide

Github Authentication:

In your host system

Run the [DevContainer]() in VS Code to get started with VSKit. The DevContainer provides a pre-configured environment with all the tools you need to start developing containerized applications. You can then use the integrated GitHub Actions to automate your CI/CD pipelines and deploy your containers to the cloud.

## How It Works

VSKit simplifies container development by integrating:

- **Dev Containers**: Pre-configured container environments for VS Code.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automate builds, tests, and deployments using GitHub CI/CD.
- **GitHub Container Registry**: Manage container images directly from GitHub Packages.

## Features

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Development environment.
- [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/): Project automation and task management.

### GitHub

> GitHub is the primary platform targetted for all Skymodules.io projects.

### GitHub Actions


### 1. Codebase

One codebase tracked in GitHub:

- **[GitHub](https://github.com)**: Centralized version control and development platform.

### 2. Dependencies

Declare and isolate dependencies:

- **[Docker](https://docker.com)**: Build, ship, and run containerized applications.
- **[OCI](https://opencontainers.org/)**: Open Container Initiative standards.

### 3. Configuration

Configuration through environment variables:

- **[DotEnvX](https://dotenvx.com/)**: Manage environment variables.
  - **[GitHub Actions](https://dotenvx.com/docs/cis/github-actions)

- **[Vault](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault)**: Secure secret management.
  - **[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-action)**

### 4. Backing Services

Integrate with cloud services:

### 5. Build, Release, Run

Automated build and run stages:

- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD for seamless automation.

### 6. Processes

Run processes as stateless containers:

- **GitHub Actions** for process execution.

### 7. Port Binding

Bind apps to ports:

- HTTP Proxy and Network Load Balancer for containerized applications.

### 8. Concurrency

Horizontal scaling by adding processes:

- **Auto-Scaling**: Dynamic scaling based on demand.
- **Horizontal Provisioning**: Add resources as needed.

### 9. Disposability

Processes as disposable entities:

- Orchestrate and manage container lifecycle efficiently.

### 10. Dev/Prod Parity

Maintain consistent environments:

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using **Terraform** for environment consistency.

### 11. Logs

Stream logs as event streams:

- **Loki** and **Vector** for log aggregation and observability.

### 12. Admin Processes

Run admin tasks as one-off processes:

- **Runbook Automation**: Automate operational tasks.

## Standards & Compliance

- **[OCI](https://opencontainers.org/)**: Open Container Initiative standards.
- **[Vector](https://vector.dev/)**: High-performance event and log aggregation.
