# ðŸ˜Ž VSKit (Visual Studio Code Kit)

**VSKit** is an advanced, intelligent development kit designed for Visual Studio Code. It simplifies the creation of containerized solutions by automating the entire lifecycleâ€” from local development to deployment. With VSKit, you can seamlessly manage your development environment, CI/CD pipelines, and container registry integration.

ðŸŒŒ SkyModules.io VS Kits:

## ðŸ˜Ž Key Features

- **VS Code Dev Containers**: Streamlined setup for development within containers.
- **GitHub Integration**: Full support for GitHub Actions, SSH integration, and secrets management.

## Quick Start Guide

Github Authentication:

In your host system

Run the [DevContainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) in VS Code to get started with [VS-Kit](https://github.com/skymodules/vs-kit). The DevContainer provides a pre-configured environment with all the tools you need to start developing containerized applications. You can then use the integrated [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to automate your CI/CD pipelines and deploy your containers to the cloud.

## How It Works

VSKit simplifies container development by integrating:

- **Dev Containers**: Pre-configured container environments for VS Code.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automate builds, tests, and deployments using GitHub CI/CD.
- **GitHub Container Registry**: Manage container images directly from GitHub Packages.
